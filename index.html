   <p class="G">On March 9, Tamil social media was awash with messages, audio clips, short videos, and personal testimonies from devoted fans: the verdict was out—Ilaiyaraaja’s first public symphony performance, in London, was a thunderous success. Throughout the day, WhatsApp groups were flooded with congratulatory messages from delirious fans, and it became clear that this was a watershed moment not only for the creator but for millions of his fans who had eagerly awaited this event. After all, this was also a promise kept (more on that later).</p>

       <p class="UL"> When the maestro, fondly called Raja by legions of fans, took to X in May, 2024, to announce that he had composed a full-fledged pure symphony in a matter of 35 days, his aficionados were overjoyed, not only because of the imminent musical feast that awaited them but also because their idol was back to doing what he does best—enthral and enchant followers through his musical explorations. For quite some time before this, Raja had become a polarising figure in Tamil Nadu, earning the ire of millions of his fans by stepping into one controversy or the other, most notably his endorsement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with many of his fans refusing to separate the musical from the political.</p>
        
       <p> For fans of a certain vintage, the symphony also brought back bittersweet memories of his first such announcement in the early 1990s. Then too, he made a pilgrimage to London and returned to much fanfare, with everyone eagerly awaiting the commercial release of a symphony. Days turned into months and years but there was no sign of the treat.
        
        Later, it became common knowledge that Raja, for reasons best known to him, had done the musical version of “pulping” a book: he had collected all available tapes of the symphony’s recording and stashed them away somewhere safe. No one knows why, and unless he reveals the reason, it would be impolite to guess.</p></div>
